# Basic Interop Skeleton

This project is a minimal skeleton for using **GLFW** with **OpenGL** and **GLAD**.  
It opens a simple window with an OpenGL context and clears the screen.

```

## Dependencies

- **CMake** >= 3.16  
- **Visual Studio 2022** (MSVC, with Desktop development with C++)  
- **GLFW** (provided in `external/glfw`)  
- **GLAD** (provided in `external/glad`)  

---

## Build Instructions (Windows, MSVC 2022, plain CMake)

1. Open **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**.  
2. Navigate to the project root.  
3. Create and enter a build folder:
   ```bat
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Configure the project with CMake:
   ```bat
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
   ```
   (You may add `-A x64` to force 64-bit explicitly.)  
5. Build the project:
   ```bat
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

The executable will be placed in `build/Release/basic_interop_skel.exe`.  
Use `--config Debug` for a Debug build.

---

## Running the Project

After building, run:

```bat
build\Release\basic_interop_skel.exe
```

A window titled **"OpenGL Triangle"** will open (currently just clears the screen).  
Press **Escape** to close it.

## Notes

- This skeleton is intended as a starting point for OpenGL projects using GLFW.  
- Event handling callbacks are defined in `main.cpp` but can be refactored into their own files as the project grows.  
- `glad` and `glfw` are integrated as part of the project through `external/`.
